# malicious-url-detection

This repository is dedicated to a research project aimed at harnessing advanced machine learning methodologies to detect malicious URLs within the cybersecurity landscape. The project delves into various hacking techniques, such as social engineering, phishing, and pharming, with a specific focus on the manipulation of URLs, which serve as a crucial component in executing malicious activities.

Central to the research is a comprehensive dataset sourced from reputable repositories like Mendeley, Phinh Tank, and Kaggle. This dataset encompasses four distinct categories of URLs: malware, benign, phishing, and defacement, providing a holistic view of the diverse threats present in cyberspace.

The repository hosts the codebase and resources associated with the research endeavor. The provided code implements a sophisticated machine learning model that seamlessly integrates lexical features and employs a combination of regression and classification techniques. Notably, the XGBoost Classifier emerges as a top performer, achieving an exceptional accuracy rate of 96.6%.

Moreover, the repository includes in-depth analyses of the functionality of the Random Forest Classifier, shedding light on its efficacy in the context of malicious URL detection. These analyses contribute valuable insights to the ongoing discourse on optimal model selection strategies in cybersecurity.

By making this code and analysis accessible, the repository aims to facilitate collaboration and knowledge exchange among cybersecurity practitioners and researchers. Additionally, it serves as a resource for those interested in replicating and extending the research findings. Ultimately, the repository underscores the significance of leveraging sophisticated machine learning techniques and tailored model selection approaches in effectively addressing the multifaceted challenges posed by malicious URL detection in cybersecurity.
